# Magnetic field Helmholtz and Maxwell coils

Code to compute the magnetic field of Helmholtz and Maxwell coils using the finite-wire approach. The notebook uses a hybrid methodology to evaluated the magnitude of the magnetic field of different arragements. It uses an iterative method based on the analytical solution of the traditional exercise of finding the magnetic field created by a current carrying wire.

This Jupyter notebook reproduce all figures of the paper **"Exploring the magnetic field of Helmholtz and Maxwell coils: a computer-based approach exploiting the superposition principle"** by García-Farieta & Hurtado (2020) published in Revista Brasileira De Ensino De Física - RBEF.
